		<h1>Hello from Codeup!</H1>
		<p>Hi everyone!<br>My name is Anthony Garza.<br>I am a current student in the Badlands cohort of Codeup.<br>Codeup is a bootcamp that teaches programming and web development.<br>I have no prior experience in computer programing or web development.<br>Although the bootcamp is <strong><em>INTENSE</em></strong>, I am loving what I have learned so far.<br>I am glad I made the decision to enroll in Codeup.<br>The decision wasn't easy because I havent been to school in while and I was scared of failure.<br>When I am not studying, I like to play golf or go to the beach. I am also a <strong>HUGE</strong> fan of the GREEN BAY PACKERS!<br>I have been to two home games in Lambeau Feild and the experience at those games was AWESOME!<br>I plan on going to many more!</p>
